### Experiment No. ‚Äì 01 
Introduction to the UNIX system: log in, log out, basic commands 
1. Use putty to log in to your UNIX account. 
2. Create a file named lab1 by using the script utility. 
3. Show the ID number of the terminal that you are using. 
4. Show your user ID (only your user id, nothing else should show up) 
5. Show all users who are currently logged in, use the utility that displays the user‚Äôs 
name 
6. Exit from the script utility. 
7. Start the script utility again, make sure to append to the same file lab1 so you don‚Äôt 
lose your previous work. 
8. Use one command to show the calendar for the previous month, current month, and 
next month. 
To do this step, you will first need to look up the man page of the utility in order to 
find the right option. Don‚Äôt show the man page in the script output file (look up the 
man page before starting script). 
9. Start the calculator and show the result of the division problem: 1 / 3, show the result 
with 2 digits after the decimal point. 
10. Show the current date and time. 
11. End the script session.

### Experiment No. ‚Äì 02 
This lab covers basic file utilities and filename expansion. 
1. Use the script utility to capture the screen output and save into a file with your choice 
of filename 
2. Use one command to create 3 empty files called test3.2, slide12, and cis2. 
3. Use wildcards to list all filenames that have the letter s in the name 
4. Use wildcards to list all filenames that have the letter s as the third character in the 
name 
5. Use wildcards to list all filenames that have the number 1 or 3 in the name 
6. Use wildcards to list all filenames that have at least 2 digits, and the digits don‚Äôt have 
to be next to each other. (A digit is a numeric value between 0 and 9) 
7. Copy file lab1-2 (the last lab assignment) to test3.2, use the interactive option and 
answer yes when prompted 
8. Use an option of the ls command to see the size in bytes of file test3.2 
9. Rename test3.2 to temp2 
10. Run a command to prove that test3.2 doesn‚Äôt exists 
11. List all files that you worked with in this lab. Use wildcards to make your command as 
short as possible (use the fact that the files all have some common character in their 
names) 
12. Use one command to delete all 3 files that you created in this lab. 
13. Exit script. Save the script output.

Certainly! Let's tackle each task step by step:

1. **Capturing Screen Output Using the `script` Utility**:
   - The `script` utility allows you to capture terminal session output.
   - To start recording, run:
     ```bash
     script my_session_output.txt
     ```
   - Perform your tasks, and when done, type `exit` to stop recording.
   - The output will be saved in the file `my_session_output.txt`.

2. **Creating Empty Files**:
   - To create the three empty files, run:
     ```bash
     touch test3.2 slide12 cis2
     ```

3. **Listing Filenames with the Letter 's'**:
   - To list filenames containing the letter 's', use:
     ```bash
     ls *s*
     ```

4. **Listing Filenames with 's' as the Third Character**:
   - To list filenames where 's' is the third character, use:
     ```bash
     ls ??s*
     ```

5. **Listing Filenames with 1 or 3**:
   - To list filenames containing either '1' or '3', use:
     ```bash
     ls *[13]*
     ```

6. **Listing Filenames with at Least 2 Digits**:
   - To list filenames with at least two digits (numeric values), use:
     ```bash
     ls *[0-9]*[0-9]*
     ```

7. **Copying `lab1-2` to `test3.2` Interactively**:
   - To copy `lab1-2` to `test3.2` interactively, run:
     ```bash
     cp -i lab1-2 test3.2
     ```

8. **Checking File Size of `test3.2` in Bytes**:
   - To see the size of `test3.2` in bytes, use:
     ```bash
     ls -l --block-size=1 test3.2
     ```

9. **Renaming `test3.2` to `temp2`**:
   - To rename `test3.2`, run:
     ```bash
     mv test3.2 temp2
     ```

10. Write a shell script to determine whether a given file exists or not. The file name is 
supplied as command line argument. Also check for sufficient number of command 
line arguments.

Certainly! Let's address each of the tasks:

1. **Adding Two Numbers from Command Line Arguments**:
   - To add two numbers supplied as command line arguments, create a shell script (e.g., `add_numbers.sh`) with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
         echo "Error: Insufficient arguments. Usage: $0 <num1> <num2>"
         exit 1
     fi

     num1=$1
     num2=$2
     sum=$((num1 + num2))
     echo "Sum: $sum"
     ```

2. **Finding the Largest Number from Three Command Line Arguments**:
   - To find the largest number from three command line arguments, create a shell script (e.g., `largest_number.sh`) with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
         echo "Error: Insufficient arguments. Usage: $0 <num1> <num2> <num3>"
         exit 1
     fi

     largest=$1
     for num in "$@"; do
         if [ "$num" -gt "$largest" ]; then
             largest="$num"
         fi
     done

     echo "Largest number: $largest"
     ```

3. **Printing Numbers in Reverse Order Using a While Loop**:
   - To print numbers from 5 to 1 in reverse order, create a shell script (e.g., `reverse_numbers.sh`) with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     num=5
     while [ "$num" -ge 1 ]; do
         echo "$num"
         num=$((num - 1))
     done
     ```

4. **Performing Basic Mathematical Operations Using a Case Statement**:
   - Create a shell script (e.g., `math_operations.sh`) with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Enter operation (+, -, *, /):"
     read operation

     case "$operation" in
         +) echo "Addition: $(($1 + $2))" ;;
         -) echo "Subtraction: $(($1 - $2))" ;;
         \*) echo "Multiplication: $(($1 * $2))" ;;
         /) echo "Division: $(($1 / $2))" ;;
         *) echo "Invalid operation" ;;
     esac
     ```

5. **Displaying Current Date, Time, Username, and Current Directory**:
   - To display this information, create a shell script (e.g., `system_info.sh`) with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Current date: $(date)"
     echo "Username: $USER"
     echo "Current directory: $PWD"
     ```

6. **Printing a Given Number in Reverse Order**:
   - To reverse a given number (e.g., 123), create a shell script (e.g., `reverse_number.sh`) with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Enter a number:"
     read num

     reversed=""
     while [ "$num" -gt 0 ]; do
         digit=$((num % 10))
         reversed="${reversed}${digit}"
         num=$((num / 10))
     done

     echo "Reversed number: $reversed"
     ```

7. **Printing the Sum of Digits of a Given Number**:
   - To calculate the sum of digits of a number (e.g., 123), create a shell script (e.g., `sum_of_digits.sh`) with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Enter a number:"
     read num

     sum=0
     while [ "$num" -gt 0 ]; do
         digit=$((num % 10))
         sum=$((sum + digit))
         num=$((num / 10))
     done

     echo "Sum of digits: $sum"
     ```

8. **Calculating Real Number Addition at the `$` Prompt**:
   - Simply type the following at the `$` prompt:
     ```
     echo "5.12 + 2.5" | bc
     ```

9. **Performing Real Number Calculation and Storing the Result in a Third Variable**:
   - To perform real number calculation and store the result, create a shell script (e.g., `real_calculation.sh`) with the following content:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     num1=5.12
     num2=2.5
     result=$(echo "$num1 + $num2" | bc)
     echo "Result: $result"
     ```

10. **Checking File Existence from Command Line Argument**
create a shell script that checks whether a given file exists or not. We‚Äôll also ensure that the correct number of command line arguments is provided.

#!/bin/bash

# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Error: Insufficient arguments. Usage: $0 <filename>"
    exit 1
fi

filename="$1"

# Check if the file exists
if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
    echo "$filename exists."
else
    echo "$filename does not exist."
fi

Save the above script to a file (e.g., check_file.sh), make it executable (chmod +x check_file.sh), and then run it with the desired filename as an argument. It will display whether the file exists or not. If no argument is provided, it will show an error message.
